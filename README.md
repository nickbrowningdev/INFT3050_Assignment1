## Description
NFL Jersey E-Commerce website from scratch using C#, specifically the ASP.NET Web Forms framework and an external database designed in SQL/T-SQL. Provided a method of forwarding customer receiptâ€™s to their email address. Built the website with a n-tier architecture so that the data management, methods and user-interface functions are separated to make the application more stable. Utilized techniques from the OWASP framework to mitigate security attacks such as SQL Injection and Broken Authentication.
